                Counter Call me Ishmael. This resonant opening of Moby-Dick, 
                the greatest novel in American literature, announces the narrator, Herman Melville, as he with a 
                measure of slyness thought of himself. In the Scriptures Ishmael, 
                a wild man sired by the overwhelming patriarch Abraham, was nevertheless the bastard son of a serving girl Hagar. 
                The author himself was the offspring of two distinguished American families, the Melvilles of 
                Boston and the Gansevoorts of Albany.

                Melville's father cast something of a blight
                 on the family escutcheon by his tendency to 
                 bankruptcy which passed down to his son. Dollars damn me, 
                 the son was to say over and over. When he sat down in the 
                 green landscape of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to compose 
                 Moby-Dick he was in debt, the father of one son, and another 
                 to be born a few days after the publication of the novel in England.
